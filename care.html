      <h1>Care</h1>
      <p>So you have your tank set up and you have your little Betta friend. So what now? You must care for them of course! Here you will find all the tips and tricks to Betta Fish care</p>
      <h3>Food and Feeding</h3>
      <p>Bettas can be downright picky eaters and tend to prefer eating food on the surface of the water instead of on the substrate of a tank. Bettas require a well-balanced diet that is rich in protein because they are primarily carnivores. It's a myth
        that bettas can survive simply by feeding on the roots of plants.<br/> Most betta keepers decide to feed pellets because they are simple and effective. Pellets create less mess and you can easily portion them out for feedings. Live, freeze-dried,
        or frozen foods can be used as treats or implemented into their daily feeding routine too.

      <h3>Tank Maintenance</h3>
      <p>Keeping a betta's tank (ecosystem) clean is crucial to their health and happiness. As your betta consumes food, digests it, and eventually gets rid of it (poop!), it ends up in the tank's water. The smaller the tank, the quicker it becomes polluted.One
        of the most common issues linked to poor betta health is sustained exposure to increased levels of ammonia and nitrites. Water quality declines as ammonia builds up from waste and uneaten food. This forces the pH level of the water to get out
        of a healthy range.Your fish will be swimming in its own waste and over time can lead to illness or even death. A good filter can help reduce these levels and establish healthy bacteria in tanks 10L or larger. Filters are not recommended for tanks
        smaller than 10L.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <strong>How Often Should You Clean A Betta Fish's Tank?</strong>
        <br/>
        <br/> A systematic maintenance schedule must be adhered to. Tanks under 10L will need more frequent and complete water changes to avoid dangerous levels of ammonia. It can be done, it's just more work. Non-filtered tanks require 1-2 water cycles
        at around 25% and a full 100% water change each week (depending on water quality). <br/> A 20L filtered tank will only need 1-2 water cycles per week at around 25% of total volume and a 100% water change once per month depending on water quality.Keep
        a pH kit in your supplies to test your tank's water. Smaller tanks and those that are unfiltered are more work in the long-run because of how rapidly the water's quality can decline.<br/> <br/> Remember, adding live plants can also help reduce
        ammonia levels in the water naturally. Water cycling (removing some and adding new) and changes (complete volume replacement) are necessary for filtered tanks too but are more frequent and important in non-filtered habitats. If you're only cycling
        the water, don't remove your betta. Unnecessary removal can lead to potential stress and injury.<br/><br/> Only remove your betta during 100% water changes. Betta fish get used to their ecosystem and don't like abrupt changes to it. Because of
        this, you should cycle more than you do a complete change. Removing too much of the existing water in the tank and then adding new can cause your fish to go into shock. This may be due to changes in water parameters or temperature. <br/><br/>        Always acclimate your betta fish when re-introducing them to their tank after a complete water change.Removing 25-50% of the tanks water and refilling with similar temperature and pH dechlorinated water is the safest route. Whenever adding new
        tap water, make sure to use dechlorination drops or spring water that has chlorine already removed. <br/> <br/>
