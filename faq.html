      <h1>FAQ</h1>

      <p>Here are some Frequantly asked Questions and myths about the Betta fish:</p>
      <h3>How long do Betta fish live for?</h3>
      <p>The average betta fish lifespan for male and females is 2-4 years in captivity. How long a betta fish will live depends on a variety of factors though. The two most important elements are how old a betta is when you get him or her, and how they
        are cared for in captivity.</p>
      <h3>Why do they Fight?</h3>
      <p>Betta males are the ones that will fight the most, in fact they will fight other males at the drop of a hat. Usually they fight to ensure they have enough food, for control of their territory and to get the female for reproduction. Betta males can
        live with females in the same tank, but putting two males in the same tank, without keeping them separate, can lead to trouble.</p>
      <h3>How big can they grow</h3>
      <p>Betta fish have an average length of 6cm when they are fully grown. On occasion and under the right conditions, a betta fish can grow to as big as 8 cm in length. How large your betta will grow will ultimately depend on its age and how it has been
        cared for. The average life span for a betta fish is 2 to 4 years in captivity.
        <br/>
        <br/> Adult male and female betta fish also differ in size if you take finnage into account. Males possess larger fins than females, however, their bodies at adulthood are generally the same size (average length). A male's fins simply make them
        larger and longer in overall appearance. Males also tend to have thicker bodies than females.</p>
      <h3>Do Betta fish have teeth?</h3>
      <p>Yes, Betta fish do have teeth, very tiny white teeth. To see these teeth you will need to take a very close up look of your Betta's open mouth. sometimes they are so small that even when having a really close up look you still may not be able to
        see them (so a magnifying glass may help).
        <br/>
        <br/> The Betta's teeth are used for feeding time. Used for chewing and munching at Betta pellets and cutting up dried Bloodworms (or any live food you may feed them) before eating them. Betta fish are carnivores, in their natural habitat they
        would feed on small waterbound insects and larvae. These fish have needed these small sharp teeth for hunting and killing from the rice paddies they originate from.
      </p>
      <h3>Do Betta fish sleep?</h3>
      <p>The question of do betta fish sleep or not usually pops up when a hobbyist finds them lying motionless and thinks they're dead, or when their fish never sits still. The reason you may not see your betta fish sleeping is because they sleep at night.
        Chances are you're sleeping too! All fish need sleep, so yes, betta fish do sleep.
        <br/>
        <br/> One interesting thing however is betta fish do not have eyelids (only sharks do!). Even when they're asleep or resting, you may think they're still awake. Avoid tapping on the tank every time they go motionless because they may be resting.
        How much do you hate when someone wakes you up from a nice snooze?</p>
