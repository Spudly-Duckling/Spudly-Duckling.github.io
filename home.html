        <h1>Welcome to Betta Days!</h1>
        <img src="images/circlelogo.png" height="250">
        <p> Here we aim to provide you with helpful information and care tips about the humble Siamese Fighting fish. The Siamese Fighting fish is one of the easiest fish to take care of, this is what makes them such a great pet for beginners. This adorable
          fancy looking fish goes by many different names that vary from region to region. They can be called:</p>
        <ul class="names">
          <li>Betta Splendens (This is their official scientific name)</li>
          <li>Betta Fish</li>
          <li>Siamese Fighting fish</li>
          <li>Chinese or Japanese Fighting fish (although slightly incorrect as they are from Thailand)</li>
        </ul>
        <p> Within Australia they are generally just called Siamese Fighting Fish but it is becoming more common to call them Betta Fish. They are commonly Known as "fighters" due to their aggressive nature. In the wild, native to areas like Cambodia and
          Thailand, the betta inhabits rice paddies and still watered canals.
          <br/>
          <br/> The ones you see in pet stores are quite different too in both colour and size, with wild betta fish having much smaller fins and being predominantly colored in a dull green or brown appearance. They are a wonderful first pet to teach
          children the responsibility of caring for something, and are inexpensive to purchase and maintain.
          <br/> Males and females look drastically different from each other, with males exhibiting the longer beautiful flowing fins. Females are much smaller in size and fin length. With proper care bettas can live anywhere from 2 to 4 years, with some
          owners having noted lifespans that extended into their teens.</p>
        <br/>

        <ul class="facts">
          <li>Betta fish like warm water and will do best at around 26 degrees celsius.</li>
          <li>There are about 73 species of the betta Splendens in the world, with several being endangered.</li>
          <li>Breeders have developed variations in colors and fins over time to appeal to pet owners. </li>
          <li>They are a carnivorous species which means they love meat! To ensure proper health and diet, make sure all pellets are high in fish or shrimp. </li>
          <li>Bettas have a unique organ called the labyrinth to breathe air outside of the water. </li>
          <li>Males build bubble nests on the surface of the water to attract females, even if one is not in the tank. </li>
          <li>Bettas like to jump and sometimes jump right out of the tank! Make sure you have a lid. </li>
          <li>After mating, the male chases the female away and protects the eggs and the bubble nest where they were laid. If the female is allowed to stay for extended period of time she will begin eating the eggs that she spawned. </li>
