      <h1>Health</h1>
      <p>You should be able to identify the difference between a healthy and a sick betta. This affects what type of care you will need to provide him or her over time. Even when first purchasing a betta fish, it is important to choose one that is healthy.
        Below are some common characteristics of healthy and sick bettas. </p>
      <h2> Healthy Signs</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Swim up to investigate when you get close to their habitat</li>
        <li>Are aggressive and may flare at you or other stimuli</li>
        <li>Possess bright colors, especially males</li>
        <li>Are hungry and eat regularly</li>
        <li>Undamaged fins</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Unhealthy Signs</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Loss of appetite for extended periods of time</li>
        <li>Lethargic and frequently hiding</li>
        <li>Dull coloring, especially in males</li>
        <li>Tattered fins with black edges</li>
        <li>White growths on body or mouth</li>
        <li>Swimming abnormally</li>
        <li>Labored breathing</li>
        <li>Clamped fins</li>
        <li>Bloated</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Sick Bettas</h2>
      <p>
        If you have a sick betta fish, you're probably feeling a little scared, confused, and anxious about how this happened. While relatively hardy fish, betta fish can suffer from parasitic, bacterial, and fungal diseases just like any other freshwater fish.
        <br/> Quick identification and treatment will minimize potential damage and get your colorful friend swimming happily again. The best way to keep your betta fish from getting sick is to keep them happy and healthy by following proper betta fish
        care.
        <br/> It's always better to be proactive than reactive. Just like you wouldn't want to be freezing or living in a dirty and cramped home, your betta fish doesn't either! That would eventually get you sick too.
        <br/>
